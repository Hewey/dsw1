		<h2>What is Esports?</h2>
		<p>Electronic sports (also known as esports or competitive gaming) is a term for organized video game competitions, especially between professionals. The most common video game genres associated with electronic sports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. Tournaments such as the League of Legends World Championship, The International, the Evolution Championship Series, and the Intel Extreme Masters provide both live broadcasts of the competition, and cash prizes to competitors.</p>
		<p>Although esports have long been a part of video game culture, competitions have seen a large surge in popularity in recent years. While competitions around 2000 were largely between amateurs, the proliferation of professional competitions and growing viewership now supports a significant number of professional players and teams, and many video game developers now build features into their games designed to facilitate such competition.</p>
		<p>The increasing availability of online video streaming platforms, particularly Twitch, has become central to current esports competitions. In 2014, sports broadcaster ESPN broadcast the The International finals, marking the first time an esports event had been simultaneously broadcast on a mainstream channel.</p>
